An old deck jockey turned bar-owner, Jericho Matsumura, is offering a gig and says he needs some muscle. The details are to be given in person. This is intended to be primarily a flavor / roleplaying mission with some light combat.","\n","ev","str","^Mission Overview and Design Goals","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^Play the Mission","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":[{"->":"intro.mission_overview"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":["^ ","\n",{"->":"intro.play_mission"},{"#f":5}]}],{"mission_overview":[["^In this mission, V is hired by bar owner Jericho Matsumura to try to scare a wannabe gangster, Leon, away from a life of crime. There are numerous outcomes that result from dialogue choices and character skills/history.","\n","^In this mission, I wanted to make a situation where just going through and doing the bare minimum results in a somewhat vague outcome. Leon isn’t dead, but he’s probably not going to survive long if he keeps doing what he’s doing. This isn’t some “scared straight” special born from the D.A.R.E. program, you can’t scare someone and expect them to turn their life around. The “best” outcome requires learning a bit about Leon and then giving him an out. You can also just murder him and then threaten Jericho into paying you anyway if you are playing a cyberpsycho sort of character.","\n","^I also included many opportunities to utilise skill checks to make the player’s character building choices feel impactful. Players can use their technical skill to dismantle Leon’s gun or their intelligence skill to recognise that Leon has hobbies other than threatening strangers in bars.","\n","^The largest fork in the mission is determined by V’s street cred. A complete no-name V without much of a reputation would probably not be able to do much of anything to change Leon’s mind, but if V is well known then Leon just might be convinced to at least hear V out. V can use this influence to help or hurt Leon (although I tried to make it clear that encouraging Leon to go out and start a gang is a bad idea).","\n","^Below you can see the general flow of the mission and its variety of choices.","\n",{"#":"IMAGE: MissionFlow.png"},"ev","str","^Back","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"intro"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"play_mission":["^Choices marked by *asterisks* will advance the mission along the critical path.
