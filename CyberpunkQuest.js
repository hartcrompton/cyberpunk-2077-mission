The bartender’s an older man in his sixties, grey/white hair slicked back with a crumpled button up pushed past his elbows. There’s an old netrunner cyberdeck mounted on the wall behind him. It’s out of date, but was definitely top of the line when it was new.","\n","^The bartender nods as the player walks in.","\n","^Jericho: You the merc? ‘Bout time you showed up.","\n","^V steps up to the bar and takes a seat.","\n","^V: Yeah, name’s V.
